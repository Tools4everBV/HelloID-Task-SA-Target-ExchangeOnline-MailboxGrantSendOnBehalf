## Prerequisites
Before using this snippet, verify you've met with the following requirements:
- [ ] The PowerShell EXO v3 module must be installed on the server running the Agent. [See instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps)

## Description

This code snippet executes the following tasks:

1. Define a hash table `$formObject`. The keys of the hash table represent the properties of the `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet, while the values represent the values entered in the form.

> To view an example of the form output, please refer to the JSON code pasted below.

```json
{
    "MailboxIdentity": "JohnD01@myenvironment.onmicrosoft.com",
    "UsersToAdd": [
        {
            "id": "JaneD01"
        },
        {
            "id": "JohnD02@myenvironment"
        },
        {
            "id": "d55a09fe-b231-XxXx-XxXx-9c369364e991"
        }
    ]
}
```

> :exclamation: It is important to note that the names of your form fields might differ. Ensure that the `$formObject` hashtable is appropriately adjusted to match your form fields.
